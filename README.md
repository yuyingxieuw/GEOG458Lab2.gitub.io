## 1. The topic as well as the parameters you have used for search
This project is about the discourse of the gig economy in two cities: London (United Kingdom) and New York (United States) 
Parameters of the location are selected, centering at the downtown of the two cities and the measured distance tries to cover most of the city areas in the map while remaining similar to make comparison make more sense.
> London: 51.50950652372234, -0.1373361577574506, 12.52 mi
> New York: 40.710681826140664,-74.00169240652883, 12mi 

## 2. Why do you want to make this comparison 
The debate around the gig economy has been fierce in recent five years especially regarding the labor relation. The definition of employees or workers from traditional labor regulations and employment standards is challenged with the booming of employment in the platform economy. Gig workers, in the most case, are not considered as formal employers which enables flexibility in both sides of employee and employer but in the meantime add vagueness in working regulation, labor rights, and minimum standards and conditions for workers.

Because of the variety of the digitally mediated work and the complexity around context rooted labor relations in the gig/platform economy, different regions and countries are different in governance and law making on this issue. Accordingly, looking at the variety of experience of work in the gig economy is interesting and meaningful in understanding how infrastructure background affects people's narrative around working as gig employees. 

This small project pick's London and NewYork as comparative cities because of a clear division on legal definition of gig workers between them. In February 2021, the UK supreme Court ruled in the Uber v. Aslam case that Uber drivers should be classified not as independent contractors but as workers entitled to basic employment protections. And this ruling fundamentally casts challenges into the "new labor relations" defined by the gig economy where workers are usually informal, flexible, and being deprived from basic social welfare protections for regular employees. But in the meantime, Uber in other cities such as New York remains in the same labor regulation. Though the US. The Department of Labor has tried to delay a proposal that would ease gig business to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees, but there is no clear opinion from the White House in regard to further regulation of the gig employers. 

Given this background, this project collects the data from London and New York based on the key word "gig economy" to see how the different infrastructure shapes the opinions and decisions around the term. My hypothesis is that discourse in London might be more around law and governmental regulations than the city of New York due to the new rule coming from the Uber v. Aslam case.

## 3. Compare the word clouds and discuss the difference or similarity among the word clouds what might be the possible reasons for the patterns you observed
The similarity is that both word clouds feature the words "work" and "workers", which means the whole discussion around the gig economy is how we define work. Whether a gig worker is a formal employee/worker or contract worker might remain at the center of the debate.

The difference is that words generated from the data in NewYork have keywords like poor, business, blogger, Forbes, etc, showing that people in NewYork might focus more on the financial perspective of the gig economy. While the world cloud in London has keywords like sue, state, and contracts, reflecting people in London might be more concerned about legal and governmental infrastructure building about the gig economy.

## 4. How your research could be improved in the future 
My research could be improved in the following four ways:
- Firstly, the 7-day limitation on dates definitely limits the results. I can only collect tweets from January 2023, which can not fully address the discourse on people's attitudes toward the gig economy. 
- Secondly, the tweets in January 2023 basically can just reflect the discussion happening right now but can not reflect the public opinion around the Uber v. Slam case that emerged in 2021. It would be great if I could have more access to the early tweets. 
- Thirdly, the location and the measured distance cover the central place of London and New York while neglecting the surrounding places which might lead to data inadequacy. I might need to experiment in different areas to see how to better represent public opinion. 
- Finally, comparing two cities is clearly not enough. Countries like New Zealand also recently passed a law to regulate the gig business. I need to do more research and loop some other counties and regions into the comparison. 

## 5. Anything you find from the map or data that is different from your expectation before the exercise, or anything that stands out to you
The general result is basically aligned with my expectation - People in London have more discussion around legal debate due to the Uber v. Alms cases. And people in New York focus more on whether the gig economy is beneficial or exploitative for its business model. 

One thing that stands out to me is that the words "Oxford", and "University" frequently emerged in the tweets from London areas. After doing some research, I realized it is because criticism around university teachers recently raised a lot of attention. The public is criticizing that Universities in the UK, led by Oxford, are "uberizing" their teachers by classifying them as contracted workers just like what the gig economy is doing. Such a trend adds more uncertainty to researchers and teachers in academia and jeopardizes their career stability and, as a result, becomes a big word in recent gig economy tweets.
